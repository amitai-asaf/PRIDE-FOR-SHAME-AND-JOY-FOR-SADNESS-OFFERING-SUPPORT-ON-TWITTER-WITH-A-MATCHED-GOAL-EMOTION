# PRIDE-FOR-SHAME-AND-JOY-FOR-SADNESS-OFFERING-SUPPORT-ON-TWITTER-WITH-A-MATCHED-GOAL-EMOTION
The aim of this research was to test people’s responses to negative emotions expressed by others – whether they involve matched or non-matched positive emotions. I predicted that people will respond more with a positive basic emotion (joy) to expressions of a negative basic emotion (sadness) and more with a positive self-conscious emotion (pride) to a negative self-conscious emotion (shame). The responses and expressions of emotions were measured by counting emotion relevant words of replies to tweets on tweeter. Tweets and replies were collected and scored via text analysis approaches using R and Python programming software. As predicted Twitter users responded with more pride related words to shame than sadness and more joy related words to sadness than shame. In addition, overall, they used more joy related words than pride related words to both sadness and shame. These findings might reflect differences that exist in the regulation of basic and self-conscious emotions.

to repeat the process the same way i did you need to run the scripts in the following order

1 : tweets (may take long, you can change the ammount of requests you send)

2 : replies (may take long, you can change the ammount of requests you send)

3 : encode

4 : conver to r

5 : organize

6 : cleaning

7 : prepocessing

8 : analyse (There are many forms of analysis in this file. All of them support the hypothesis, some of them even to a greater extent than the one we used. The one we used is tagged as #This is the analysis#)
